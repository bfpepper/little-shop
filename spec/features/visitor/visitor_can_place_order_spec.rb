# As a visitor
# When I add items to my cart
# And I visit "/cart"
# And I click "Login or Register to Checkout"
# Then I should be required to login
# When I am logged in
# And I visit my cart
# And when I click "Checkout"
# Then the order should be placed
# And my current page should be "/orders"
# And I should see a message "Order was successfully placed"
# And I should see the order I just placed in a table
