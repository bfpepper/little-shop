# Background: Items, and a user that is not logged in
#
#   As a visitor
#   When I visit any page with an item on it
#   I should see a link or button for "Add to Cart"
#   When I click "Add to cart" for that item
#   And I click a link or button to view cart
#   And my current path should be "/cart"
#   And I should see a small image, title, description and price for the item I just added
#   And there should be a "total" price for the cart that should be the sum of all items in the cart
