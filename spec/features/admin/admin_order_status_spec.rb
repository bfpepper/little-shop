# As an Admin
# When I visit the dashboard
# Then I can see a listing of all orders
# And I can see the total number of orders
#   for each status ("Ordered", "Paid", "Cancelled", "Completed")
# And I can see a link for each individual order
# And I can filter orders to display
#   by each status type ("Ordered", "Paid", "Cancelled", "Completed")
# And I have links to transition between statuses
# - I can click on "cancel" on individual orders which are "paid" or "ordered"
# - I can click on "mark as paid" on orders that are "ordered"
# - I can click on "mark as completed" on orders that are "paid"
